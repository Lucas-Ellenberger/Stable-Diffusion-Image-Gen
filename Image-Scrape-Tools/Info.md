# Web Scraping Tool

## API Keys

You will need to insert valid google search API keys for the tool to work.

## Usage

The tool does not verify an image is relevant to the query. The assumption is the first google image result will be the most relevant image to the query.

This tool was used to make datasets for our models unique needs in a short period of time. We used the search query as the associated label to the image.
